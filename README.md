This project contains three example React applications.

## Demos
* reactdemo - a simple demo showing the use of state and props. This also shows the use of Javascript classes and  arrow functions.
* routerdemo - adds react-router to the previoud example. This allows us to control the app via the URL.
* reduxdemo - a demo showing a simple use case for redux used with react to keep app state in a global redux store.

## How to Use This Project
Simply open any of the demos and run `npm install` followed bu `npm start` to see them in action. You should go through all the code and read the comments; I put them there just for you!
